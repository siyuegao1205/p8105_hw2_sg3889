# Problem 1

## Reading and Cleaning

First, read and clean the raw dataset. Only retain line, station, name,
station latitude / longitude, routes served, entry, vending, entrance
type, and ADA compliance.

``` r
transit_data = read_csv("data/NYC_Transit_Subway_Entrance_And_Exit_Data.csv") %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% 
  select(line:vending, ada) %>% 
  mutate(
    route8 = as.character(route8),
    route9 = as.character(route9),
    route10 = as.character(route10),
    route11 = as.character(route11),
    entry = ifelse(entry == "YES", TRUE, FALSE)
    )
```

To this point, after reading in the raw dataset, I used `select`
function to make the `transit_data` retain only 20 variables, including
`line`, `station_name`, `station_latitude`, `station_longitude`, route
served (`route1` to `route11`), `entry`, `entrance_type`, `exit_only`,
`vending`, and `ada`. The resulting dataset contains 1868 rows and 20
columns. `route1` to `route7` are recognized as character by R, however,
`route8` to `route11` are recognized as numeric. As a result, I used the
`mutate` function to convert it into character variable. The `entry` of
`yes` / `no` is converted into a logical variable.

The data are not “tidy”: route served should be a single variable. In
this case, we may need to convert `route1` to `route11` from a wide to a
long format.

## Some Questions

Now I would answer some questions using these data as required in the
Homework instructions.

1.  How many distinct stations are there?

``` r
transit_data %>% 
  select(line, station_name) %>% 
  distinct() %>% 
  nrow()
## [1] 465
```

There are 465 distinct stations.

2.  How many stations are ADA compliant?

``` r
transit_data %>% 
  filter(ada == TRUE) %>% 
  select(line, station_name) %>% 
  distinct() %>% 
  nrow()
## [1] 84
```

There are 84 stations that are ADA compliant.

3.  What proportion of station entrances / exits without vending allow
    entrance?

For this question, I first subset the dataset limited to `vending` ==
`NO`. Then, I count the `entry` variable and get the proportion.

``` r
transit_data %>% 
  filter(vending == "NO") %>% 
  count(entry) %>%
  mutate(prop = n/sum(n))
## # A tibble: 2 × 3
##   entry     n  prop
##   <lgl> <int> <dbl>
## 1 FALSE   114 0.623
## 2 TRUE     69 0.377
```

37.7% of station entrances / exits without vending allows entrance.

## Reformatting

First, convert `route` to long format by `pivot_longer()`.

``` r
transit_tidy_data = pivot_longer(
    transit_data,
    route1:route11,
    names_to = "route_num",
    names_prefix = "route",
    values_to = "route")
```

Then, we can answer some questions based on the tidy dataset.

-   How many distinct stations serve the A train?

``` r
transit_tidy_data %>% 
  filter(route == "A") %>% 
  select(line, station_name) %>% 
  distinct() %>% 
  nrow()
## [1] 60
```

There are 60 distinct stations serving the A train.

-   Of the stations that serve the A train, how many are ADA compliant?

``` r
transit_tidy_data %>% 
  filter(route == "A") %>% 
  filter(ada == TRUE) %>% 
  select(line, station_name) %>% 
  distinct() %>% 
  nrow()
## [1] 17
```

Of the stations that serve the A train, there are 17 stations that are
ADA compliant.
